            <item>The mind is everything. What you think you become.</item>
            <item>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.</item>
            <item>Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is.</item>
            <item>I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship.</item>
            <item>Either you run the day, or the day runs you.</item>
            <item>Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right.</item>

            <item>Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.</item>
            <item>The best revenge is massive success.</item>
            <item>People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing. That’s why we recommend it daily.</item>
            <item>Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.</item>
            <item>There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.</item>

            <item>You can’t fall if you don’t climb. But there’s no joy in living your whole life on the ground.</item>
            <item>We must believe that we are gifted for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.</item>
            <item>Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.</item>
            <item>Challenges are gifts that force us to search for a new center of gravity. Don’t fight them. Just find a new way to stand.</item>
            <item>I have learned over the years that when one’s mind is made up, this diminishes fear.</item>

            <item>In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.</item>
            <item>A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.</item>
            <item>The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person who is doing it.</item>

            <item>It is not what you do for your children, but what you have taught them to do for themselves, that will make them successful human beings.</item>
            <item>If you want your children to turn out well, spend twice as much time with them, and half as much money.</item>
            <item>I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.</item>
            <item>A truly rich man is one whose children run into his arms when his hands are empty.</item>
            <item>What’s the point of being alive if you don’t at least try to do something remarkable.</item>
            <item>Life is not about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.</item>
            <item>Nothing in the world is more common than unsuccessful people with talent.</item>
            <item>Knowledge is being aware of what you can do. Wisdom is knowing when not to do it.</item>
            <item>Your problem isn’t the problem. Your reaction is the problem.</item>
            <item>You can do anything, but not everything.</item>
            <item>I am thankful for all of those who said NO to me. It’s because of them I’m doing it myself.</item>
            <item>A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.</item>
            <item>The number one reason people fail in life is because they listen to their friends, family, and neighbors.</item>
            <item>If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.</item>
            <item>There are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world: those who are afraid to try and those who are afraid you will succeed.</item>
            <item>Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.</item>
            <item>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.</item>
            <item>The starting point of all achievement is desire.</item>
            <item>Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.</item>
            <item>All progress takes place outside the comfort zone.</item>
            <item>You may only succeed if you desire succeeding; you may only fail if you do not mind failing.</item>
            <item>Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear – not absence of fear.</item>
            <item>Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.</item>
            <item>We become what we think about most of the time, and that’s the strangest secret.</item>
            <item>The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.</item>
            <item>The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.</item>
            <item>I will not let age change me. I will change the way I age.</item>
            <item>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.</item>
            <item>A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication, the competitive drive and if you are willing to sacrifice the little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done.</item>
            <item>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.</item>
            <item>Don\'t be distracted by criticism. Remember–the only taste of success some people get is to take a bite out of you.</item>
            <item>The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don\'t have any.</item>
            <item>The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it, as long as you really believe 100 percent.</item>
            <item>We can’t help everyone, but everyone can help someone.</item>
            <item>Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.</item>
            <item>Strive for progress, not perfection.</item>
            <item>The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.</item>
            <item>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</item>
            <item>A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.</item>
            <item>If you judge people, you have no time to love them.</item>
            <item>The best way out is always through.</item>
            <item>If you are not obsessed with your life, you are wasting your time.</item>
            <item>The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.</item>
            <item>Don\'t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.</item>
            <item>No masterpiece was ever created by a lazy artist.</item>
            <item>If you can\'t do great things, do small things in a great way.</item>
            <item>You are the sum of your habits.</item>
            <item>The best view comes after the hardest climb.</item>
            <item>Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.</item>
            <item>If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.</item>
            <item>You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.</item>
            <item>I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</item>
            <item>The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.</item>
            <item>The greatest wealth is health.</item>
            <item>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</item>
            <item>You’re not getting older, you’re getting better.</item>
            <item>The groundwork for all happiness is good health.</item>
            <item>A healthy outside starts from the inside.</item>
            <item>Take care of your body. It\'s the only place you have to live.</item>
            <item>Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person\'s physical, emotional, and mental states.</item>
            <item>To keep the body in good health is a duty… otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.</item>
            <item>Health is a state of body. Wellness is a state of being.</item>
            <item>Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness.</item>
            <item>The reason I exercise is for the quality of life I enjoy.</item>
            <item>Health is not about the weight you lose, but about the life you gain.</item>
            <item>The man who has health has hope; and he who has hope, has everything.</item>
            <item>If you have health, you probably will be happy, and if you have health and happiness, you have all the wealth you need, even if it is not all you want.</item>
